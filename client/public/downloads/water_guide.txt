SMART HEALTH NORTHEAST - WATER PURIFICATION GUIDE

CAUTIONS:
1. Do not consume floodwater directly under any circumstances.
2. Clear water does not always mean safe water; invisible pathogens may be present.
3. Store treated water in clean, covered containers to prevent re-contamination.

PREVENTION STEPS:
1. BOILING: Bring water to a rolling boil for at least 1 minute (3 minutes at higher altitudes).
2. CHLORINATION: Use 1 chlorine tablet (Halogen) per 20 liters of water. Wait 30 minutes before drinking.
3. FILTRATION: If water is cloudy, filter it through a clean cloth before treating.
4. SOLAR DISINFECTION: Expose clear water in transparent bottles to direct sunlight for 6 hours.

EMERGENCY:
If you experience diarrhea or vomiting, start ORS immediately and contact the closest Health Center.
